          "We'll start with commands that will make the game easier to enjoy (and nicer for me to code):\n"
          "1. >Run< This command can be used to begin sprinting. You're character will only have a certain number of turns to run (scroll down for information on turns), until they run out of breath\n"
          "and starting walking again.\n"
          "2. >North<>South<>East<>West<. These directions can be used in tandem with the 'Go' command to have you character travel across the map. These directions are key to your travel.\n"
          "3. >Go<. This may be the most important. Go allows your character to move. It is required to state the certain direction using the North, South, East, or West commands (a movement command could look like:\n"
          "'go south'.\n"
          "4. >Hit< This command (and many other variations of harming something), will engage your character in combat with whatever of your choosing. This could consist of: 'hit yourself'. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n"
          "5. >Eat<>Drink<>Sleep< These commands are important for your basic survival. (Not required for gameplay, only for roleplay)\n"
          "6. >Help< This will open up a menu that allows you to look at the handbook, or the all important ASK FOR ADVICE feature (may bring upon an untamed amount of excitement and joy)\n"
          "7. >Roll< This command is used for rolling dice in the way of checks. Just like dnd, you will occasionally have a chance to show off your abilities whether it be through brains, brawn, ect\n"
          "There are 7 different possible rolls you can choose from; 1d2, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12, and 1d20. If you are lost, don't worry! The game will explain more of this later on.\n"

          "9. >Interact< This command allows you to interact with certain objects in the world.\n"
          "\nNext we will go into the definition of each stat:\n"
